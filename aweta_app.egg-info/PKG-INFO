# AWETA

## Standalone build (no Python required for end users)

This project can be packaged into a single executable using PyInstaller.

Notes:
- You must build on each target OS (macOS build for macOS, Windows build for Windows).
- The app uses Tkinter (bundled with Python) and `python-snap7` for PLC comms.

### macOS (on macOS)

```bash
bash scripts/build_macos.sh
```

Result: `dist/aweta-app` (console binary). Launching will open a terminal and the Tkinter GUI.

Note: If you see a warning that "tkinter installation is broken" and the GUI
does not appear, install a Python that includes Tk:

- Recommended: install Python from python.org (macOS universal installer), then rerun the build
- Or: `brew install tcl-tk` and use a Python built against that Tk (advanced)

### Windows (on Windows)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build_windows.ps1
```

Result: `dist/aweta-app.exe`.

### Running

- On macOS: `./dist/aweta-app`
- On Windows: `dist\\aweta-app.exe`

If the PLC cannot be reached, the app will show a snap7 status and continue the simulation.
